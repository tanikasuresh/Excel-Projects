### The following dashboard was created from a fictional sales company during 2021.

First, we see a ranked list of the company's salespeople based on the sum of revenue they generated in 2021. Nancy Freehafer brings in the most revenue with over $100,000 and Jan Kotas brings in the least with less than $20,000. It would be appropriate to look into the performances of the underperformes salespeople (those bringing in less than $40,000-$50,000) and develop a personalized plan to improve their results including constructive feedback, more training, monitoring their progress, and more.

The next graph displays the salespeople and a breakdown of the products they sell based on the percentage of revenue the sales bring in. We can isolate each salesperson by using the Excel slicer on the right. For example, if we select Nancy Freehafer

It is evident that Beverages bring in the most revenue followed by sauces and jams, preserves.On the opposite end, Fruit and Veg and Grains do not sell as well and bring in less than $10,000 in revenue combined. As a result, consider adjusting the inventory to hold more of the better performing items and less of the worse performing items to reduce the cost of keeping inventory taht does not sell. Or, consider developing a sale or marketing plan to garner more interest in the lower perofmring cateogires.

Next, we see the total revnue by each month in 2021. It seems that revenue in 2021 was at its lowest in February, and hit a peak in December. The largest increase occured from November to December, and the largest decrease occured from June to July.
