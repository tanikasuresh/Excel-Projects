## Excel

To teach us how how to use Excel PivotTables, PivotCharts, and a few functions, the professor provided the class with a fictional company's sales spreadsheet that includes the following attributes:
- Order ID
- Order Date
- Customer ID
- Customer Name
- Address
- City
- State
- ZIP/Postal Code
- Country/Region
- Salesperson
- Region
- Shipped Date
- Shipper Name
- Ship Name
- Ship Address
- Ship City
- Ship State
- Ship ZIP/Postal COde
- Ship Country/Region
- Payment Type
- Product Name
- Category
- Unit Price
- Quantity
- Revenue
- Shipping Fee

With these records, we can create various PivotTables and PivotCharts, and recreate those with the Pivot feature using Excel functions like sumifs, countifs, and averageifs.
